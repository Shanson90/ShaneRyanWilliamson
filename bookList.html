		In my freshman year of college, I visited my dad's sister, who's husband is a judge.  I was struck by the number of books in their house.  Everywhere  I looked, there were books piled and shoved into corners, in bookshelves, as risers for their tv - so many books there was nowhere to put them. I decided then and there that I was going to read more, and I was going to buy the books I read so I too could have a library of all the books I read.  Since, I've discovered a few problems with this plan.  First, books are really heavy, and suck to move.  Second, I simply don't have room in my apartment for all the books I plan to read. Finally, hard copy books are bad for the environment, so I've gone digital.  So this is my digital bookshelf.  I needed somewhere to cataloge the books I read, somewhere to display my reading accomplishments.  I plan for this page to be that display.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, 2011</p>
					<p>Still reading...</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Show Your Work!, Austin Kleon, 2014
					</p>
					<p>
						Read February 2016
					</p>
					<p>
						A very short book, Kleon essentially encourages artists of all types to publish often and early.  While not exactly profound, the book did get me creating more art (like this booklist) and that could lead to something profound. Probably not.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The Martian, Andy Weir, 2011</p>
					<p>Read June 2015</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						How to Create a Mind, Ray Kurzweil, 2012
					</p>
					<p>
						Read May 2015
					</p>
					<p>
						Proof isn't the right word, but it's not too far off. Humans are just machines.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand, 1957</p>
					<p>Read August 2009</p>
					<p>It took me two tries and almost two years to finish this beast, but it was very influencial on me as an already individualistic teen. I later found out Rand is said to be an INTJ like me. It seems she got a little carried away with her idealistic ideas though.  If you want to understand the best parts of capitalism, (without any offsetting citicism) look no further.</p>
