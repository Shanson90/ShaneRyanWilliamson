							Have a project you want some help with? I have great news!
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm in the process of becoming a software developer, and I'm in dire need of challenging projects to work on. I'm still a baby in the coding world, so I'm currently offering my services <strong><em>for free</em></strong>. Don't fret. While I'm no expert, I wrote the code for this page from scratch, have developed a few small ruby programs, and can solve just about any problem I put my mind to. I also have a diverse background in business experience from which a draw. This allows me to understand your business and quickly attack your most critical objectives first. I'm not your standard geek. I'm a business consultant that solves problems with technology.

							More importantly, <em><strong>what do you have to lose?</strong></em>
