							Well, I'm about two months away from failing to become a developer within a year of leaving EY.  I'm richer, older, and wiser, and I know a lot more code than I did ten months ago, but I'm no full stack developer.  I look back over the last ten months and think, where the hell did it go? At the same time, ten months doesn't seem so long as it did a few years ago.  The days crawl and the years fly.
						</p>
						<p>
							So I'm forced to ask what the fuck I've done with my life the last ten months. Well I've learned a lot about derivatives and hedge accounting.  The finance is somewhat interesting. The accounting still sucks. I've also become pretty handy in javascript.  I'd say it's now the language I know best, save Excel, if that counts. I finally figured out how to lace together some HTML and JS to get out of the damn console and do something with my JS.  That was a big breakthrough. I'm shocked at how disjointed most of the front end materials are out there - they teach you HTML and CSS in tandem, as they should.  They teach you JS. Why don't they lace it all together? HTML and CSS are pretty lame without JS to do some computation. JS is pretty boring without a site to run on. I digress.   
						</p>
						<p>
							I snowboarded a lot. I drank a good bit. I worked some pretty long hours more often than I expected. I made more money than I expected. I wrote a macro in VBA that saved my company a lot of time and money. I forgot every bit of VBA I learned as quickly as possible because fuck that language.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em><strong>I got engaged.</strong></em>
						</p>
						<p>
							The truth is, I really enjoyed myself the last ten months.  I found out that the culture you work in is perhaps the single most important part of your work.  I found out that I can really enjoy my work as long as I'm building things.  Creating intricate accounting templates to automate the accounting bullshit we do and pitching those templates to my team and getting appreciation and a bit of intra-company fame among the accountants that can't build generalized solutions to save their lives is pretty damn fulfilling.   
						</p>
						<p>
							I learned going to a programming bootcamp is really fucking expensive and I can't afford it. The problem is I can't afford not to do it. This is my life we're talking about. I can't waste it away doing something I wasn't built for and will never master. Overall, I think if I abstract enough, the last ten months were a success. While I didn't meet my goal of becoming a full stack web developer, I met my goal of finding happiness, and let's face it - the programming is only a means to that end.
						</p>
						<p>
							So let's try again.  There's a class starting in Denver in July and I'm really hoping I can figure out how to take six months off and change my life. In the meantime, I'm young, in love, and pretty rich compared to the other 7 billion people out there, so fuck it.

							This Friday will be my last day with <a href="http://www.ey.com">EY,</a> the accounting firm I've worked at for the last year and a half since I graduated from <a href="http://www.oru.com">ORU</a> with a bachelor's in accounting. I worked in "assurance" which is just a fancy name for audit.  Basically we're hired to check out a company's financial statements and make sure they're in accordance with the applicable reporting standards. It will come as no surprise to anyone that knows me that this was easily the worst job I've ever had, in terms of the work itself. Don't get me wrong. I can say nothing bad about the company, the people I worked with, what I got paid, the hours, or any of the normal Big 4 complaints. I just hated the work.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's interesting, because I'm no doubt a very detail-oriented individual. That said, I'm not what I'll call "process-oriented." I'm more "concept-oriented." The best way I can articulate this distinction is I'm more interested in answering the question of "why?" than I am "how?" Accounting is well-suited for process-oriented thinkers, because all accounting aims to do is take something that already happened, and walk it through a process to arrive at HOW to account for it in monetary terms. There are endless rules that are like a series of if-then statements you have to work through to arrive at the correct action. A mind that can latch on to these processes and recall them at will when needed is invaluable in the profession.  In contrast, thinking about WHY the transactions happened in the first place is not very helpful.   
						</p>
						<p>
							So it's been rough. I know I'm smart. I know I work hard. Yet, I always feel so incompentent compared to so many of my associates at EY. I'm tempted to ask, "What's wrong with you? Figure it out Shane. You can do anything you put your mind to." The truth is, I probably could. I would never be a great auditor, but I could be good enough to make a lot of money over the next 10 years. So what's the problem? I would never be happy.
						</p>
						<p>
							I guess that's the reason for this post. I want to talk about happiness, and how I plan to achieve it. Growing up, we never really had quite enough money. I don't mean we were poor in terms of our household income. I mean specifically we never had enough for all the things we wanted. My parents were rich early in life, lost their fortune, and never really adjusted to a modest lifestyle. This engrained in me a deep desire to be rich so I didn't have to deal with all of the stress that came from spending all you make, regardless of how much or little you have. I would even say I thought the old "money can't buy happiness" proverb was blatantly false. Sure, unlimited money without having to work would probably buy most people happiness, but who is that an option for? Generally, money comes at a price. Generally, that price is work. If you spend all day doing something you hate, how much money do you need to offset that cost? Probably more than the job pays.
						</p>
						<p>
							This brings me to another proverb, "Love your work, and you never have to." I think that's the essense of what I've learned. Everyone should spend as much time as they need to find something they really love. It's not easy. Regardless of what that thing is, one should pursue it with everything they have. EVERYTHING. Some things are harder to monetize than others, and that makes it harder for those of us who pick fields that only pay well at the top. That said, who cares? If you love the work, who cares how much you get paid. It's like a perpetual vacation. You do what you love every day until you're good enough to get a lot of money for it. If that never happens, you probably didn't try hard enough. More importantly, you still got to do what you love every day for your entire life. That's about the best you can hope for anyway. 
						</p>
						<p>
							So what is it that I'm going to do to be happy? In a word, code. This page, and this first blog post, are the product of daring to pursue happiness in lieu of money. Over the next year I will become a full stack Ruby on Rails developer. So far I'm making strides with core Ruby and HTML/CSS (I coded this site from scratch) and will add in some other languages as I'm more comfortable with these first few. If you like my story, and think I could help you by implementing a better website than what you currently have, let me know. I'm currently working for free to gain experience. Please, use me!
