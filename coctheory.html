						<strong>My fellow clanmates:</strong>
					</p>  
					<p>
						First of all, if you don't know me, my name is Shane, and I go by Shanson on CoC. I created this page so that I could refer people to something global and public. I see a lot of people talking about who they're attacking before war starts. I also see a lot of people make terrible strategic mistakes in war.  I want to try to end these mistakes so we win more wars. I've developed a strategy that guarantees we get as many stars as possible. Everytime we stick to it, we get a lot of stars, and most of the time we win. So without further ado, the strategy: 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<strong><em>Attack Strategy</em></strong>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The lower the enemy base, the easier it is to get 3 stars.  The higher, the harder. Wars are won and lost only based on total stars, so the "cheapest" stars to get are at the bottom.  Therefore, we start at the bottom and work our way up, so we get all the cheap stars we possibly can, until we run out of attacks. To implement this, the lowest individual from our clan with an attack left should theoretically always be the next to attack, and should attack the lowest possible base with less than 3 stars. Whoever is ranked highest in our clan (per the war map) should be the very last to attack.
					</p>

					<p>
						So what does this mean for you?  First and foremost, it means the lower you are on the war map, the earlier you must attack.  Second, it means you need to be very active during the portion of the war day where you should attack. For example, let's say you're #15 in a war of 25. You don't need to be online when war starts, because a full 20 attacks will happen before it's officially your turn. However, you need to check in every few hours to see what progress has been made. As more and more attacks below you happen, you need to check in more often so you can attack as soon as its your turn. When is it your turn? In theory as soon as #14 uses his second attack, #15 should attack. I realize sometimes, particularly with second attacks, there is a lag as a new army has to be built. It's ok to deviate from the strategy by one or two bases, but not more. In other words, if you're ready to attack and #14 on our side is waiting for an army, discuss with #14 and you can go ahead and use one attack. But if there is doubt about #14 3-starring the next base, you should probably wait.  
					</p>

					<p>
						I'll be the first to admit that we deviate from this strategy at the end. The reason is it makes more sense to get 2 stars on all the bases at the top as opposed to getting 3 stars on one or two bases and leaving the very top untouched. For most, this part of the strategy is irrelevant as only about the top 5 people are involved. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong><em>Clan Castle Strategy</em></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						We (TH and the Co-Leaders) have played a lot of CoC, and have come up with what we think is best to have in the defensive war clan castles. If you disagree, we're totally open to suggestions (see the info page to shoot me an email), but until a new strategy is employed, don't fill any of the clan castles with anything other than what is below. Further, we only use maxed witches, level 5+ Wizards, and Level 6+ Archers. If someone makes a mistake and fills your castle with something other than what you see below, please delete the troops immediately. A Co-Leader will fill it back up before war starts. See below for the set up we want, based on clan castle capacity. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>30 CC Capacity</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>1 Witch......(12 spaces)</li>
									<li>2 Wizards.....(8 spaces)</li>
									<li>10 Archers...(10 spaces)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>25 CC Capacity</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>1 Witch....(12 spaces)</li>
									<li>2 Wizards...(8 spaces)</li>
									<li>5 Archers...(5 spaces)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>20 CC Capacity</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>3 Wizards...(12 spaces)</li>
									<li>8 Archers....(8 spaces)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>15 CC Capacity</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>2 Wizards...(8 spaces)</li>
									<li>7 Archers...(7 spaces)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>10 CC Capacity</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>1 Wizard....(4 spaces)</li>

								</ul>
